Still the use of engines, mostly diesel engines is hard to avoid. And let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: Smoke of diesel engines is often seen on sailing vessels. Most of it can be avoided by adjusting the motor, make sure you do this. What cannot be easily avoided is burning of fuel and emission of carbon dioxide. My point I want to make here is: use HVO fuel to reduce Carbom Emissions and smoke as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Battery Wiring</title><link>https://lucy.hamburg/posts/wiring/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucy.hamburg/posts/wiring/</guid><description>&lt;p>You want your battery wiring as simple and robust as it gets. For many people it is like some black magic to do battery wiring and George came to the rescue 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George explained the essentials very well - what elements you need and how to connect them. See for yourself in the youtube video below.
George introduced a wiring scheme which I converted to a drawing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the original scheme:

&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Contessa 32&lt;/strong>, designed by David Sadler and built by Jeremy Rogers Ltd, strikes a balance between classic long keel boats and modern fin keel boats. Its semi-long keel with skeg design, inspired by the Contessa 26, offers efficient upwind performance and exceptional seaworthiness. The Contessa 32, renowned for its stability and practical interior layout, is a popular choice for sailors prioritizing comfort and performance at sea.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
