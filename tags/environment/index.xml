Still the use of engines, mostly diesel engines is hard to avoid. And let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: Smoke of diesel engines is often seen on sailing vessels. Most of it can be avoided by adjusting the motor, make sure you do this. What cannot be easily avoided is burning of fuel and emission of carbon dioxide. My point I want to make here is: use HVO fuel to reduce Carbom Emissions and smoke as well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
