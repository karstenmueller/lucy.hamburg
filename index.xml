&lt;p>You want your battery wiring as simple and robust as it gets. For many people it is like some black magic to do battery wiring and George came to the rescue 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>George explained the essentials very well - what elements you need and how to connect them. See for yourself in the youtube video below.
George introduced a simple wiring scheme which I converted to a drawing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the original scheme:

So sailing goes with the current, ideally adapted to the tide 😉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lucy’s home port is Hamburg. Hamburg lies on the Elbe and sailing begins right outside the harbour entrance. In my case, the entrance to the Rüschkanal harbour at Finkenwerder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Elbe is a tidal area; the current does not always flow downstream as in all rivers but, thanks to the flood tide, sometimes flows upstream. To have fun and make progress, one generally follows the tide. It sets the rhythm and the timings for departure and arrival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://lucy.hamburg/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucy.hamburg/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-i-love-about-sailing">What I Love About Sailing&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Being immersed in Nature:&lt;/strong> Sailing allows you to spend time outdoors, experience nature up close, and enjoy the fresh sea breeze.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Escape and Relaxation:&lt;/strong> Sailing offers a break from everyday life, stress, and hustle. It creates space for calm, silence, and the feeling of escaping the daily grind to clear your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Community and Togetherness:&lt;/strong> Everyone on board works together, strengthening the sense of community. Spending time with family and friends on a boat is especially valuable as you share a common goal and enjoy meaningful conversations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boat</title><link>https://lucy.hamburg/boat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucy.hamburg/boat/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="contessa-32-lucy--a-sailing-yacht-with-charm-and-tradition">Contessa 32 &amp;lsquo;Lucy&amp;rsquo; – A Sailing Yacht with Charm and Tradition&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>If it looks right, it possibly is right&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Contessa 32&lt;/strong> was designed in the 1960s by the British designer &lt;strong>David Sadler&lt;/strong> and built by &lt;strong>Jeremy Rogers Ltd&lt;/strong>. It is distinguished by its sturdy construction and excellent sailing characteristics, making it ideal for both regattas and long, leisurely passages on the open sea. Measuring 9.75 metres in length and 2.50 metres in beam, it is a popular mid-sized yacht, admired for its stable hull shape and longevity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Delivery from Hayling Island</title><link>https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lucy was built in England and was launched for the first time in Lymington on 7 March 1979. I also purchased Lucy in England. Robin Milledge was a great help to me during the purchase, and I can highly recommend him as a surveyor! See &lt;a href="https://rozelmarine.co.uk">Rozel Marine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Hayling Island, the yard &lt;a href="http://haylingyacht.co.uk/">Hayling Yacht Company&lt;/a> carried out a refit. Structural issues were addressed and the engine was overhauled.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="winter-in-the-boat-shed">Winter in the Boat Shed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I undertook some of the work myself and visited the yard several times. The yard is beautifully situated. Working in the cold boat shed was no pleasure. Most boats in England are kept outside over winter, so I was glad to be able to work indoors.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
