I also purchased Lucy in England. Robin Milledge was a great help to me during the purchase, and I can highly recommend him as a surveyor!

&lt;p&gt;At Hayling Island, the yard &lt;a href="http://haylingyacht.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Hayling Yacht Company&lt;/a&gt; carried out a refit. Structural issues were addressed and the engine was overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;
 
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I undertook some of the work myself and visited the yard several times. The yard is beautifully situated. Working in the cold boat shed was no pleasure. Most boats in England are kept outside over winter, so I was glad to be able to work indoors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><media:content xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/featured.jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
