At Hayling Island, the yard Hayling Yacht Company carried out a refit. Structural issues were addressed and the engine was overhauled.
Winter in the Boat Shed
I undertook some of the work myself and visited the yard several times. The yard is beautifully situated. Working in the cold boat shed was no pleasure. Most boats in England are kept outside over winter, so I was glad to be able to work indoors."><meta name=author content="Karsten"><link rel=canonical href=https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://lucy.hamburg/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://lucy.hamburg/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://lucy.hamburg/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://lucy.hamburg/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://lucy.hamburg/apple-touch-icon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=de href=https://lucy.hamburg/de/posts/delivery/><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://lucy.hamburg/posts/delivery/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Sailing Lucy"><meta property="og:title" content="Delivery from Hayling Island"><meta property="og:description" content="Lucy was built in England and was launched for the first time in Lymington on 7 March 1979.
