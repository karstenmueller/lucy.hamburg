Elbe means [tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide). So sailing goes with the current, ideally adapted to the tide 😉

Lucy’s home port is Hamburg. Hamburg lies on the Elbe and sailing begins right outside the harbour entrance. In my case, the entrance to the Rüschkanal harbour at Finkenwerder.

The Elbe is a tidal area; the current does not always flow downstream as in all rivers but, thanks to the flood tide, sometimes flows upstream. To have fun and make progress, one generally follows the tide. It sets the rhythm and the timings for departure and arrival.

You will find a quiet Guest berth at Rüschkanal to spend the night where you can provide their boats with fresh water and electricity. See [Guest Information](https://svfh.de/gaeste-info/)
