## Silverrudder WTF 😳

I've often thought about what it would be like to participate in the [Silverrudder](https://www.silverrudder.com)?
Just do the "Around Funen" all in one go? That alone is crazy enough, and then doing it alone...

*Silverrudder non-stop, around 134 nautical miles in 30 hours (if things go well)*

The Silverrudder is a solo regatta where participants sail around the Danish island of Funen. It starts and finishes in Svendborg. It's considered the largest solo regatta in the world and sells out quickly every year. The regatta attracts a wide variety of boats, from small monohulls and multihulls to larger vessels.

I've already failed to register once. Around 400 sailors participate in the regatta each year, and registration usually sells out within minutes. Well, this year it worked out, and I'm registered!

The excitement is slowly building, and I'm busy with the final preparations. On September 19, I'll be competing in the "Medium Keelboat" group, and you can follow my position here:
