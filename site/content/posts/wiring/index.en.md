You want your battery wiring as simple and robust as it gets. For many people it is like some black magic to do battery wiring and George came to the rescue 😉

George explained the essentials very well - what elements you need and how to connect them. See for yourself in the youtube video below.
George introduced a wiring scheme which I converted to a drawing.

For the original scheme see image above. And this is the diagram style scheme:

Wiring diameters: 35mm for the battery cables, 6mm for the charger and 10mm for the B2B.

If you like to modify the diagram just open the file in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/?src=about#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Flucy.hamburg%2Fposts%2Fwiring%2Fwiring.drawio#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22UcFnGM5fcW15tLSDESSC%22%7D) or download it [here](wiring.drawio)
