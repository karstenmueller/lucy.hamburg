At the moment, not that much is fixed yet. That will come later…

## Overview

- The route goes from Hamburg westward, into the Solent and further west: West Country, possibly the Isles of Scilly, possibly to the Channel Islands such as Guernsey and Sark.

- The start and end of my sailing sabbatical in 2026 are set: departure is at the beginning of June, and by the end of August I want to be back home in Hamburg.  
  Whether [Lucy](/boat/) will also be back in Hamburg by then or stay in England is not yet clear (hence the variants below).

- On both the outbound and return journeys, I’d like to sail longer legs (>60 nm), so we’ll also be underway overnight at times. We’ll be sailing in tidal waters, ideally with the current and when we have enough water under the keel.

- I’m hoping for a friendly, relaxed atmosphere on board. I want to get to know the land and people in England and France and also sail a few regattas. Those will be more sporty, but always easygoing.

A few regattas should be included as well:

- The Co32 Regatta. This coincides with the event “60 Years Contessa 32”; what exactly will take place there is still unclear.
- The Classic Channel Regatta is attractive, but unfortunately overlaps in time with the Round the Island (RTI) Regatta. Current idea: prefer the Channel Regatta.

And of course also some “cruising” time to get to know the land and people and to take a break now and then 😊

## Preliminary Planning – Itinerary

Legend:
- 🤔: Desired number of people on board
- 👍: Number confirmed
- **Crew**: Who is on board (+ [Karsten](/sailing))
- Crew change: Possible here; elsewhere potentially as well. For rough travel planning, [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com) is quite helpful.
